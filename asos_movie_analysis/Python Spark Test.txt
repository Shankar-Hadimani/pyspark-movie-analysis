Spark Test
===========
Use the MovieLens 100K Dataset for this exercise. It can be downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/.
Dataset is available under http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip. 
Please refer to the Read Me file at http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m-README.txt for details about the data.

Use Python (optionally with Pandas) to complete the following test. Your code should be in production quality. 

1. Define the project folder structure and dependencies using Conda or Pipenv.
2. Write Python code to generate the following outputs in the target directory inside the project.
    A. A CSV file containing list of users with no of movies they rated and average rating per user.
       CSV file should contain 3 columns, ie: UserId, No of Movies, Average Rating. Column headers are not required. 
    B. A CSV file containing list of unique Genres and no of movies under each genres
        CSV file should contain 2 columns, ie: Genres, No of Movies. Column headers are not required. 
    C. Generate a parquet file that contain the top 100 movies based on their ratings. This should have fields, Rank (1-100), Movie Id, Title, Average Rating. Rank 1 is the most popular movie. 

Create a zip file that contains your project including any test data you used and send it to us.
Do not include the large data files because it can make the zip file bigger. 
You do not need to include any output files since we can generate them by running your code.
